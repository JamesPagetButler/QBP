## Part I: Individual Document Evaluations

### Document A: Claude

#### First Impression
*What struck me on initial reading?*

[Your notes here]

#### Mathematical Verification

**The Core Derivation:**
- Does it correctly derive vecDot(ψ, O) = cos θ for quaternions at angle θ? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Partial
- Is each step justified? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Mostly
- Are there hidden assumptions? [ ] Yes (specify) [ ] No

**Limiting Cases:**
| Angle | Expected P(+) | Document's P(+) | Correct? |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| θ = 0° | 1.0 | | |
| θ = 90° | 0.5 | | |
| θ = 180° | 0.0 | | |

**Errors Found:**
- [ ] None
- [ ] Minor (list):
- [ ] Major (list):

#### Depth Assessment

**The "Why" Question:**
Does the document explain *why* quaternion geometry encodes measurement probabilities?
[ ] Yes, clearly [ ] Partially [ ] No, just shows that it does

*Evidence:*

**The Counterfactual Test:**
Does it consider what would happen under different assumptions?
[ ] Yes [ ] No

*If yes, what alternatives were considered?*

**The Surprise Test:**
Did the document contain any unexpected observations or insights?
[ ] Yes [ ] No

*If yes, what surprised me?*

**The Explanation Test:**
Could a bright undergraduate learn from this?
[ ] Yes, would gain understanding [ ] Would learn procedure only [ ] Would be confused

#### Scores for Claude

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
