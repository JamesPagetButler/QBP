# qphysics.py
# The computational heart of our quaternion-based physics project.

"""
This library will contain the core functions and classes for our formalism.
It will be developed incrementally as required by the experiments on our Eight-Fold Path.

Initial thoughts for contents:
- A Quaternion class (or we can use an existing, well-tested library).
- Functions for quaternion operations (conjugate, inverse, norm).
- Definitions for our quaternion-based state vectors and operators.

# We will start building this out to tackle the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
