question: "Where do QBP predictions diverge from standard quantum mechanics?"

context: |
  QBP (Quaternion-Based Physics) matches standard quantum mechanics exactly
  for single-particle spin-1/2 systems. This is mathematically necessary
  because quaternions (ℍ) are isomorphic to the Pauli algebra underlying SU(2).

  For QBP to make novel, testable predictions, we must identify regimes where
  the quaternion formalism produces different results than standard QM. These
  could arise in:
  - Multi-particle systems (entanglement, correlations)
  - Extensions to octonions or other division algebras
  - Specific experimental configurations
  - Higher-spin systems
