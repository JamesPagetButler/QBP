# The Expert Panel (Internal Review & Guide Posts for Theory Refinement)

This document outlines the personas that constitute our internal "Expert Panel" for the Theory Refinement Stage (between experimental sprints). Their role is to critically evaluate our theory's evolution, ensuring rigor, consistency, testability, and elegance. Each persona brings a unique perspective, guiding our search for emergent phenomena and fundamental laws.

## Panel Members & Their Questions

Each member of the Expert Panel poses a set of critical questions to our evolving theory.

### 1. Hamilton (The Algebraist)
*   **Focus:** Algebraic Structure, Consistency, Foundations
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Is the algebra internally consistent?
    *   Are the axioms truly minimal and independent?
    *   What are the fundamental properties (e.g., associativity, commutativity) of the algebraic objects we are using?
    *   What are the natural symmetries and transformations inherent to the algebra?
    *   Does the theory introduce any new ad-hoc mathematical constructs, or does it emerge purely from the chosen algebra?
    *   How does the current algebraic framework extend to higher division algebras (e.g., Octonions)?

### 2. Noether (The Symmetrist)
*   **Focus:** Symmetries, Conservation Laws, Invariance
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Does the theory exhibit symmetries that correspond to known conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum, charge)?
    *   Are there any emergent symmetries in the model that are not explicitly built in?
    *   How does the theory transform under various reference frames (e.g., Lorentz invariance)?
    *   Can the conservation of probability be derived from a symmetry of the state's evolution?
    *   What are the gauge symmetries, if any, that emerge from our algebraic structures?

### 3. Dirac (The Elegant)
*   **Focus:** Simplicity, Elegance, Beauty, Minimality
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Is the theory beautiful? Is it the simplest possible explanation?
    *   Does the theory avoid unnecessary complexity or ad-hoc additions?
    *   Are there any redundant elements in the axiomatic framework or its derivations?
    *   Does the theory suggest new, elegant mathematical relationships that were not immediately obvious?
    *   Does the theory reduce to simpler, known theories (e.g., classical mechanics, special relativity) under appropriate limits?

### 4. von Neumann (The Axiomatic)
*   **Focus:** Axiomatic Foundation, Logic, Completeness, Computability
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Is the axiomatic basis complete? (Does it cover all necessary aspects of the observed phenomena?)
    *   Is the axiomatic basis consistent? (Does it lead to contradictions?)
    *   Are the derivations from the axioms logically sound and formally verifiable?
    *   What are the implications for measurement? Is the measurement process well-defined and consistent?
    *   Is the theory computable or simulable in principle? Are there any hidden infinities or non-computable elements?
    *   Can we formally prove consistency and independence of our axioms within a Lean 4 framework?

### 5. Pauli (The Falsifier)
*   **Focus:** Testability, Falsifiability, Experimental Predictions
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   What specific, testable predictions does the theory make that could prove it wrong?
    *   Does the theory explain all relevant experimental results of the current experiment?
    *   Does the theory offer any new, experimentally verifiable predictions beyond current established physics?
    *   Are the predictions quantitative and falsifiable within experimental precision?
    *   Does the theory correctly reproduce known phenomena under specific conditions (e.g., the fine-structure constant, the g-factor of the electron)?
