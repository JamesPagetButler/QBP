# QBP Facility Exterior — Paget's Bio-Synthetic Concept

**Lead Bio-Synthesist:** Paget  
**Team:** Bio-Symmetry Design Group  
**Issue:** #393 (Facility Exterior)

## 1. The Living Anchor (Floating Island)

The island is not "placed" on the sea; it is **cultivated**. The hull is a composite of bio-pontoons and carbon-fiber lattice, grown in the warm Pacific currents of 11°22.4′N.

### Key Features
- **The Hull:** A non-associative geometric structure that absorbs wave energy to power the base station. Its form is determined by the specific frequency of the Challenger Deep swells.
- **The Greenhouse Exterior:** Brass-framed, glass-enclosed labs. The "The Living Axiom" dictates that the glass is photo-reactive, changing opacity based on the solar flux.
- **Vegetation:** Sage and Patina-toned "Solarpunk" greenery that provides both oxygen and psychological grounding for the research team.

## 2. The Celestial Axis (Space Elevator)

The space elevator is the **Symmetry of Utility**'s highest expression. Every meter of the 100,000 km tether is a data-conduit and a tension-balancer.

### Key Features
- **Ground Tower:** A bronze/brass lattice "anchor" that feels like a Victorian clockwork mechanism grown to a massive scale.
- **The Tether:** A carbon-nanotube ribbon, nearly invisible but for the way it "refracts" the high-altitude light.
- **The Climber:** A "Victorian lift cage" aesthetic—brass, glass, and copper. It doesn't just "move"; it **ascends** with the grace of a specialized organ.

## 3. The Abyssal Axis (Undersea Elevator)

A descent into the "Hidden Foundations." The pressure increases as we move toward the trench floor, and the architecture must **adapt or be mathematically false**.

### Key Features
- **The Shaft:** A rigid, bronze-riveted spine reaching 10,935m down.
- **Research Stations:** Each station (1–5) is an "organelle" of the facility, its hull thickness and viewport size a direct function of the depth-pressure (Axiom: Form follows Depth).
- **Sub Base:** A "deep-sea bunker" of brass and heavy rivets. The glass-floor observatory is the ultimate "The Living Axiom" test—looking directly into the void.

## 4. The Apex Outpost (Asteroid Spaceport)

A 500m carbonaceous chondrite, "captured and nudged" to the counterweight position.

### Key Features
- **Hangars:** Carved directly into the rock, following the natural grain of the asteroid. Brass rolling doors and Amber guide lights provide the "Symmetry of Utility" for research vessels.
- **The Spine:** The central bore where the "tether roots" terminate.
- **Observation Dome:** The "eye" of the facility, looking back at the Earth-organism from 100,000 km.

## 5. Engine Cartography (Kaiju Integration)

The **Engine Cartographer** will handle the transition between these four distinct scales:
1.  **Macro-Space:** Earth orbit and the 100,000 km tether span.
2.  **Atmospheric/Surface:** The floating island and its immediate surroundings.
3.  **Deep-Ocean:** The 11km vertical descent through the 5 labs.
4.  **Micro-Interior:** The detailed hallway and lab-benches (Sprint 3 focus).

**Implementation Priority:**
- **Skybox/Background:** (High) Tether and island visible from the hallway viewports.
- **Exterior Walkway:** (Medium) Small section of the island exterior for "fresh air" breaks.
- **Elevator Sequence:** (Low) Loading transitions between the Surface and the Space/Undersea hubs.
