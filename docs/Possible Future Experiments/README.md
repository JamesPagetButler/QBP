# Possible Future Experiments

## Purpose

This directory collects experiment ideas that go beyond the current 10-sprint roadmap (experiments 01–09). Each proposal follows the template below so that when we're ready to prioritise, we have enough context to make a decision.

## Proposal Template

When adding a new experiment idea, create a file `NNN_short_name.md` using this structure:

```
# Title

## Motivation
Why is this interesting for QBP? What question does it answer?

## Physical Setup
Brief description of the experimental configuration.

## What We'd Simulate
BPM parameters, geometry, observables.

## Expected QBP Signature
What would the quaternionic coupling change relative to standard QM?

## Key References
Papers, DOIs, relevant prior art.

## Feasibility Notes
- BPM capability: can our current code handle this?
- Computational cost: grid size, propagation distance, runtime estimate
- Blockers: what would need to change first?

## Status
[ ] Idea | [ ] Scoped | [ ] Ready to schedule
```
