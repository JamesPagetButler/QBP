## 1. Summary of Findings

This analysis validates the QBP prediction for angle-dependent spin measurement:

$$P(+) = \cos^2(\theta/2) = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}$$

**Key Results:**
- All 9 test angles (0° to 180°) fall within the 3σ acceptance threshold
- Maximum deviation: 1.7500σ (threshold: 3.0σ)
- χ² goodness-of-fit: χ² = 4.9597, p = 0.6649 (df = 7)
- The quaternion-based measurement framework reproduces standard QM predictions exactly

## 3. χ² Goodness-of-Fit Test

The χ² test evaluates whether the measured distribution matches the theoretical prediction.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| χ² statistic | 4.9597 |
| Degrees of freedom | 7 |
| p-value | 0.6649 |
| Significance level | α = 0.05 |
| Result | PASS (p > 0.05) |

**Interpretation:** The measured data is statistically consistent with the theoretical prediction. The deviations are explained by expected statistical fluctuations.

## 4. Visualizations

### 4.1 Probability vs Angle

![Probability Curve](probability_vs_angle.png)

The smooth teal curve shows the theoretical prediction P(+) = cos²(θ/2). Brass markers show measured probabilities with error bars (±1σ). All measurements lie on or very close to the theoretical curve.

### 4.2 Deviation Analysis

![Deviation Plot](deviation_analysis.png)

Each point shows how far the measured probability deviates from the prediction, measured in standard deviations (σ). The shaded bands indicate ±1σ (teal), ±2σ (amber), and ±3σ (red) regions. All points fall well within the ±3σ acceptance threshold.

## 6. Conclusion

**Experiment 01b: PASS**

The QBP framework's angle-dependent measurement prediction has been validated:

1. **Mathematical agreement:** The measured probabilities match P(+) = cos²(θ/2) at all test angles
2. **Statistical significance:** χ² = 4.9597 with p = 0.6649 confirms the data is consistent with theory
3. **Acceptance criteria:** All points within 1.75σ of prediction (threshold: 3σ)

This result confirms that quaternion-based quantum mechanics correctly predicts spin measurement outcomes for arbitrary angles, extending the validation from Experiment 01 (orthogonal case only) to the full angular range.
