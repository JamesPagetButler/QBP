## 1. Summary of Findings

This analysis validates the results of the Stern-Gerlach synthetic experiment against the theoretical ground truth. The simulation demonstrates a clear binary quantization of spin and a probabilistic split of outcomes that aligns with quantum mechanical predictions. The measured results fall well within the defined acceptance criteria, confirming the validity of the `qphysics.measure` implementation for orthogonal measurements.

## 2. Comparison with Ground Truth

**Ground Truth Parameters:**
*   **Total Particles (N):** `1,000,000`
*   **Expected Probability P(+):** `0.5`
*   **Expected Mean Count (μ):** `500,000`
*   **Standard Deviation (σ):** `500.00`
*   **Acceptance Criterion:** Measured count must be within 3σ of the expected mean.

**Simulation Results:**
| Metric                  | Spin Up (+1)      | Spin Down (-1)    |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measured Count**      | `500,207`        | `499,793`      |
| **Measured Probability**| `0.500207` | `0.499793` |
| **Deviation from Mean** | `207` | `207` |
| **Deviation (in σ)**    | `0.4140`    | `0.4140`    |

## 4. Conclusion

The deviation of the measured counts from the expected mean is **0.4140σ**.

Since this value is less than or equal to the 3σ acceptance criterion, the experiment **PASSES**.

This result provides strong evidence that the QBP framework's implementation of quantum measurement is consistent with the foundational principles demonstrated by the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
