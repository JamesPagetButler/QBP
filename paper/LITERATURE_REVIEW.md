# Literature Review & Foundational Works

This document serves as the core bibliography and intellectual foundation for the Quaternion-Based Physics (QBP) project.

## Core Hypothesis Synthesis

Our project's methodology is a deliberate synthesis of two powerful, and in some ways opposing, philosophies in modern physics:

1.  **The Feynman Approach (Pragmatic Experimentalism):** Embodied by Richard P. Feynman, this approach prioritizes physical intuition, computational prowess, and, above all, comparison with experiment. It is a "guess and check" methodology on the grandest scale: guess a new physical law, compute all its consequences, and see if it matches reality. It is less concerned with the mathematical "beauty" or "inevitability" of the initial guess and more concerned with its predictive power.

2.  **The Furey Approach (Algebraic Realism):** Championed by researchers like Cohl Furey, this approach posits that the Standard Model, while successful, is mathematically "ad-hoc" and that the fundamental laws of nature should emerge directly from the structure of a single, unified algebraic system. The focus is on finding the "one right structure" from which everything else can be derived. The research program centers on the division algebras (Reals, Complex, Quaternions, Octonions) as the most likely candidates for this fundamental structure.

**Our Synthesis:** We are using a **Feynman-esque methodology** to conduct a rigorous test of a **Furey-esque hypothesis**. We are taking the "guess" of algebraic realism seriously and applying the "compute the consequences and compare to experiment" loop to it.

## Core Bibliography

### Primary Sources (Directly Informing the Project)

1.  **Feynman, Richard P.** *QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter*. Princeton University Press, 1985.
    -   *Relevance:* Provides the philosophical and pedagogical template for explaining complex physics with simple rules, diagrams, and a focus on "what the numbers are." Our goal is to explain our results with this level of clarity.

2.  **Furey, Cohl.** "Standard model physics from an algebra?" PhD Thesis, University of Waterloo, 2015. (arXiv:1603.04172)
    -   *Relevance:* This is the central text for the "algebraic realism" hypothesis. Furey's work demonstrating how to find SU(3) symmetries within the octonions is the inspiration for our attempt to find SU(2) and U(1) symmetries within the quaternions.

3.  **Adler, Stephen L.** *Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields*. Oxford University Press, 1995.
    -   *Relevance:* The most comprehensive and authoritative text on the formal mathematical structure of quaternionic quantum mechanics. This book provides the rigorous foundation for our work and serves as the ultimate reference for ensuring our library is mathematically sound.

4.  **Baez, John C.** "The Octonions." *Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society*, vol. 39, no. 2, 2002, pp. 145-205. (arXiv:math/0105155)
    -   *Relevance:* An exceptionally clear and insightful survey of the properties of the division algebras, including the quaternions. It explains *why* these algebras are special and provides the mathematical context for Furey's hypothesis.

### Secondary Sources (Experimental & Conceptual Background)

1.  **Griffiths, David J.** *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*. Cambridge University Press, 2018.
    -   *Relevance:* Serves as the canonical textbook for the standard (complex-based) quantum mechanics that we are benchmarking our model against.

2.  **Sakurai, J. J., and Jim Napolitano.** *Modern Quantum Mechanics*. Cambridge University Press, 2017.
    -   *Relevance:* A graduate-level text that provides the formal details for many of the experiments on our roadmap, such as Bell's Theorem and the g-2 experiment.
