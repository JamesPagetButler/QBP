# A Quaternion-Based Formulation of Physics

## Abstract

This document chronicles an attempt to build a coherent physical formalism derived from the mathematical properties of quaternion algebra. Our guiding hypothesis is that the fundamental laws of nature can be expressed as a direct consequence of this algebraic structure. The project's success will be measured by its ability to reproduce the results of key experiments in quantum and relativistic physics in a manner that is both mathematically elegant and computationally verifiable.

## The Eight-Fold Path of Verification

We have defined a sequence of eight critical experimental and theoretical benchmarks to guide our work. We will proceed through this list sequentially, and successful validation at each step is required before proceeding to the next.

1.  **The Stern-Gerlach Experiment:** Test the basic quantization of a spin-1/2 state. This is our entry point.

2.  **The Double-Slit Experiment:** Test the formalism's ability to handle superposition, path integrals, and the wave-particle duality of matter.

3.  **The Lamb Shift:** A precise measurement of a tiny energy shift in the hydrogen atom, providing a critical test against Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).

4.  **The Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Electron (g-2):** The most precisely verified prediction in physics. The formalism must be able to account for this value.

5.  **Bell's Theorem Experiments:** Test the formalism's handling of quantum entanglement and non-locality.

6.  **Derivation of Particle Statistics:** The formalism must naturally produce the distinction between fermions (Fermi-Dirac statistics) and bosons (Bose-Einstein statistics).

7.  **The Hydrogen Atom Spectrum:** The formalism must be able to solve for the quantized energy levels of the simple proton-electron system from first principles.

8.  **Gravitational Lensing & Galactic Rotation Curves:** The ultimate test. The theory must reproduce the predictions of General Relativity on cosmological scales and ideally offer insight into the phenomena currently attributed to dark matter.
