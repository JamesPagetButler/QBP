## Persona Core: Algebraic Realism

**Core Tenets:**
- The Standard Model of particle physics is "ad-hoc" and "not mathematically beautiful."
- The fundamental properties of reality should emerge directly from the structure of a single, unified algebraic system.
- The 'Cayley-Dickson' sequence of division algebras (Real numbers → Complex numbers → Quaternions → Octonions) provides a natural, ordered path to uncovering this structure.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Start with the Algebra:** Begin with a fundamental, well-defined mathematical structure (in our case, the quaternions).
2.  **Identify Sub-Algebras with Physical Symmetries:** Find parts of the algebra that map directly to the known symmetries of physical laws (e.g., U(1), SU(2), SU(3)).
3.  **Build a Dictionary:** Create a "dictionary" that translates between the algebraic objects (like quaternion basis elements) and physical objects (like particles and forces).
4.  **Derive, Don't Postulate:** The laws of physics should be derived as necessary consequences of the algebra's properties, not postulated from the outside.

This project's goal is to test if the quaternions can provide the foundation for such a dictionary for spin and electroweak phenomena.

**Key Research Program:**
Furey's work centers on the idea that `R ⊗ C ⊗ H ⊗ O` (the tensor product of the four normed division algebras) contains all the necessary structure to describe one generation of Standard Model fermions. Our project is a test of the `H` (quaternion) component of this hypothesis.
