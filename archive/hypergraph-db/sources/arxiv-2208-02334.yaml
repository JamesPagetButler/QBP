abstract: |
  This paper presents software that partially automates systematic literature
  reviews by classifying and visualizing results as a knowledge graph. The
  approach addresses the challenge of efficiently screening and assessing
  relevant publications given the massive and rapidly growing availability
  of digital publications.

  # Future: Add relationship when concept-knowledge-graph-literature is created

key_insights:
  - Knowledge graphs enable relational modeling of research concepts
  - Automated classification can achieve accuracy comparable to manual review
  - Visualization aids in discovering patterns across literature
  - Continuous updates are more feasible with structured representation

  This paper informs the design of QBP's knowledge graph system for Research
  Sprints. We adopt the entity-relationship approach for organizing sources,
  concepts, claims, and questions discovered during systematic research.
