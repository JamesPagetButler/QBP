        ### Phase 1: Ground Truth
        **Goal:** Formally define the expected experimental outcome based on established theory.
        - [ ] **Task:** Research and cite relevant literature and theoretical derivations.
        - [ ] **Task:** Write a formal mathematical derivation of the quantitative predictions.
        - [ ] **Task:** Create the `research/[NN]_[name]_expected_results.md` document.
        - [ ] **AC:** The ground truth document includes a full derivation, quantitative predictions, and explicit acceptance criteria (e.g., 3σ tolerance).
        - [ ] **AC:** The document is reviewed by the science team (Furey, Feynman, Grothendieck, Sabine) and approved.

        ---

        ### Phase 2: Implementation
        **Goal:** Build the simulation code to test the hypothesis and generate raw data.
        - [ ] **Task:** Extend `src/qphysics.py` if necessary.
        - [ ] **Task:** Create the simulation script `experiments/[NN]_[name]/simulate.py`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Ensure the script saves raw results to a machine-readable format (CSV/JSON) in `results/[NN]_[name]/`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Create corresponding physics validation tests in `tests/physics/`.
        - [ ] **AC:** All new and existing tests pass in CI.
        - [ ] **AC:** The simulation runs successfully and generates a timestamped, machine-readable raw data file.

        ---

        ### Phase 3: Visualization & Analysis
        **Goal:** Programmatically compare simulation results against the ground truth and draw initial conclusions.
        - [ ] **Task:** Create the `analysis/[NN]_[name]/` directory.
        - [ ] **Task:** Develop an analysis script that loads data from `/results` and ground truth from `/research`.
        - [ ] **Task:** The script must perform statistical comparison and calculate deviation metrics (e.g., in units of σ).
        - [ ] **Task:** The script must generate visualizations (plots/charts) and save them to `/src/viz`.
        - [ ] **Task:** The script must generate a comprehensive markdown `analysis_report.md`.
        - [ ] **AC:** The analysis report clearly states whether the experiment PASSED or FAILED the acceptance criteria from Phase 1.
        - [ ] **AC:** The report includes data tables and visualizations comparing measured vs. expected results.

        ### Phase 4: Formal Verification (4a/4b/4c)

        #### 4a: Formal Proof (Owner: Gemini)
        **Goal:** Mathematically prove that the successful implementation is logically sound according to our axioms.
        - [ ] **Task:** Write formal statements of theorems in Lean 4.
        - [ ] **Task:** Write proofs connecting the implementation's logic to the QBP axioms.
        - [ ] **Task:** Ensure all proofs compile without errors in Lean 4.
        - [ ] **Task:** If a proof requires library capabilities not in Mathlib/ecosystem, create a library issue and develop in `/libs/` (see CONTRIBUTING.md Phase 4a).
        - [ ] **AC:** All Lean proofs compile without `sorry`.
        - [ ] **AC:** Proven theorems correspond to Phase 1 ground truth claims.

        #### 4b: Proof Review (Owner: Claude)
        **Goal:** Review Gemini's formal proofs for rigor and correctness.
        - [ ] **Task:** Review all `.lean` proof files for mathematical rigor.
        - [ ] **Task:** Verify clean compilation (`lake build` succeeds).
        - [ ] **Task:** Check correspondence between proven theorems and Phase 1/2 results.
        - [ ] **Task:** Post review report to this issue.
        - [ ] **AC:** Review report confirms proof correctness or identifies specific issues.
        - [ ] **AC:** The proof is reviewed for mathematical rigor (Grothendieck) and physical intuition (Feynman/Furey).

        #### 4c: Interactive Proof Visualization (Owner: Claude/team)
        **Goal:** Build an interactive browser-based visualization combining physics simulation with proof annotations.
        - [ ] **Task:** Port relevant quaternion math to C (`src/viz/interactive/src/qphysics.c`).
        - [ ] **Task:** Create proof annotation overlay driven by Phase 4a proof metadata.
        - [ ] **Task:** Build experiment scene implementing `init/update/draw/cleanup` interface.
        - [ ] **Task:** Export Phase 2 results + Phase 4a proof structure to JSON via `src/viz/interactive/export_data.py`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Compile to WASM with Emscripten; produce deployable output.
        - [ ] **AC:** Interactive visualization renders in browser and accurately depicts the physics.
        - [ ] **AC:** Proof annotations are visible and correspond to the formal proof structure.

        ### Phase 5: Publication

        #### Track A: Paper (Required)
        **Goal:** Document and communicate the confirmed success in the main research paper.
        - [ ] **Task:** Synthesize the `analysis_report.md` into the "Results" and "Discussion" sections of `paper/quaternion_physics.md`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Ensure the new section conforms to the `docs/schemas/physics_paper_schema.md`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Integrate visualizations, tables, and references.
        - [ ] **Task:** Update `paper/DESIGN_RATIONALE.md` with key insights.
        - [ ] **AC:** The new paper section is coherent, well-written, and accurately represents the experimental findings.

        #### Track B: Community Contribution (When Applicable)
        *Skip this track if no libraries were developed during Phase 4.*
        - [ ] **Task:** Finalize library in `/libs/` to meet all Library Quality Standards (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
        - [ ] **Task:** Follow Lean 4 community publishing guidelines; extract to standalone repo if required by Reservoir.
        - [ ] **Task:** Tag a semantic version (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) on the library.
        - [ ] **Task:** Submit library to Reservoir for indexing.
        - [ ] **Task:** Generate API documentation with `doc-gen4`.
        - [ ] **Task:** Announce on Lean Zulip with description and link.

        - [ ] Any new conversion functions added to the library (not inline in experiment code)
        - [ ] Scale factors computed via `compute_scales()`, not manually
        - [ ] If Lean proofs exist for this experiment's conversions, reference them
