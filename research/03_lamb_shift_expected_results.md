# Expected Results for the Lamb Shift Experiment

This document outlines the real-world experimental results for the Lamb Shift, establishing the "ground truth" that our synthetic tests must replicate. This is a critical test of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).

## 1. The Phenomenon

In the hydrogen atom, the Dirac equation predicts that the 2S₁/₂ and 2P₁/₂ orbitals should have exactly the same energy level (they should be "degenerate").

The Lamb Shift is the experimentally observed, tiny energy difference between these two states. The 2S₁/₂ state is slightly *higher* in energy than the 2P₁/₂ state.

*   **Observed Value:** ≈ 1057 MHz (or 4.37 x 10⁻⁶ eV)

## 2. Experimental Method (Lamb-Retherford)

The classic experiment measured this tiny split indirectly:

1.  **Source:** A beam of hydrogen atoms is prepared, with many in the long-lived (metastable) 2S₁/₂ state.
2.  **Interaction:** The beam passes through a precisely controlled microwave field.
3.  **Transition:** The microwaves provide the exact energy needed to "bump" the 2S₁/₂ electrons into the short-lived 2P₁/₂ state.
4.  **Decay & Detection:** Once in the 2P₁/₂ state, the atoms rapidly decay to the ground state (1S₁/₂), emitting a photon. They are therefore "quenched" from the beam. A detector at the end of the apparatus measures the *decrease* in the number of 2S atoms arriving.
5.  **Result:** By finding the precise microwave frequency that causes the maximum decrease in detected 2S atoms, the energy difference between the two states is measured.

## 3. Key Insights & Ground Truth

The existence of the Lamb Shift cannot be explained by simple quantum mechanics or even Dirac's relativistic equation. Its explanation is a foundational triumph of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).

*   **The Cause:** The energy shift is caused by the "self-interaction" of the electron with the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. The electron is constantly emitting and re-absorbing virtual photons, which effectively "smears out" its position and slightly weakens its interaction with the nucleus. This effect is more pronounced for the 2S state, raising its energy level.

*   **Significance:** The Lamb Shift is direct, measurable evidence of the existence of vacuum energy and virtual particles.

## 4. Success Criteria for Our Synthetic Test

This is a highly advanced test for our quaternionic formalism. Success requires our theory to have a mechanism that can model the "self-interaction" of a particle.

*   **Primary Goal:** Our quaternionic model for the hydrogen atom must predict that the 2S₁/₂ and 2P₁/₂ energy levels are **not degenerate**.
*   **Quantitative Goal:** The formalism should produce a calculated energy split between these two states that is close to the experimentally observed value of **1057 MHz**.

Successfully predicting a non-zero Lamb Shift would be a major validation of our model's ability to go beyond simple quantum mechanics and incorporate QED-like effects.
