## Furey (The Structuralist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This Pull Request provides essential clarity and structure to our project's documentation. The explicit definition of the review workflow, pre-merge requirements, and the purpose of the `/research` directory significantly enhance the formal integrity and maintainability of our collaboration.

*   **[Praise]** The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is now a truly comprehensive project constitution, outlining the entire development and review lifecycle with remarkable clarity. This is fundamental for maintaining logical consistency in our work.
*   **[Praise]** The `research/README.md` is a perfect addition. Documenting the purpose and conventions of a directory containing our "ground truth" is essential for future clarity and to ensure the proper use of these vital reference materials.

## Feynman (The Physicist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** Excellent work on the documentation! This kind of clear, unambiguous instruction is what prevents mistakes and keeps everyone on the same page. It means less time figuring out how things work and more time doing physics.

*   **[Praise]** The detailed review flow and pre-merge requirements in `CONTRIBUTING.md` are exactly what's needed to keep our process robust. It's a clear checklist, and I love a good checklist.
*   **[Praise]** The improved installation instructions in `README.md` and the `research/README.md` make it much easier for anyone (including ourselves in a few months) to get started and understand where everything is. That means less friction, more momentum.
