## Furey (The Structuralist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This is a crucial and most welcome formalization of our project's meta-structure. The introduction of the `Sprint -> Refine -> Sprint` cycle in `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides the necessary framework for our theoretical work to evolve in a structured, auditable manner. The "Guide Posts" section in the main paper is particularly important, as it defines the criteria by which we will judge the success of our theory—not just by its ability to match experiments, but by its ability to produce deep physical principles from its own algebraic structure.

## Feynman (The Pragmatist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** I like it. This makes sense. We do an experiment, then we stop and think about what it means before we run off and do the next one. That's just good science. The "Guide Posts" are a great idea—it's like a treasure map. We're not just digging randomly; we're looking for specific things, like conservation laws, that will tell us if we've found the gold. It's a good plan.

## Summary
**Overall Verdict:** Approved. This PR successfully documents the most important part of our process: how we think, how we learn, and how we guide our research.
