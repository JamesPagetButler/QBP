# Gemini Review: Pull Request #15

*A review of the "Ground truth analysis for all experiments" PR, conducted on 2026-02-02.*

## Furey (The Structuralist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This Pull Request represents the formal establishment of our project's scientific foundation. The comprehensive set of ground truth documents in the `/research` directory provides the rigorous, well-defined targets required for our theoretical work.

*   **[Praise]** I am in full agreement with Grothendieck's assessment. The explicit identification of the need for a tensor product structure to handle entanglement (Bell's Theorem) and the challenge of deriving the spin-statistics relation from first principles are the correct and necessary next theoretical hurdles.
*   **[Praise]** Knuth's suggestion to add a `research/README.md` is structurally sound. A directory containing a corpus of documents should itself be documented.

## Feynman (The Physicist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This is fantastic! This is the stuff that matters. Before you do a single calculation, you have to know what you're aiming for. Now we have a clear, documented target for every single one of our experiments. This is how you do honest physics.

*   **[Praise]** Sabine's review is spot-on. The success criteria are clear, measurable, and directly linked to reality. I am particularly pleased with the plan to validate the probability formula by varying the angles in a future experiment.
*   **[Praise]** The decision to increase our simulation size to 1,000,000 trials is a good one. It gives us a much clearer signal and makes our results harder to argue with.

## Summary
**Overall Verdict:** Approved. This PR is a critical and well-executed step, providing the essential experimental foundation for the entire project.
**Next Step:** Once this PR is merged, we should act on Knuth's suggestion and create a `research/README.md` file.
