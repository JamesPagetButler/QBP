*A review of the "Address Red Team review feedback" PR, conducted on 2026-02-01.*

## Furey (Algebraist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This set of changes is exemplary. The update to `paper/quaternion_physics.md` correctly and elegantly incorporates the foundational "Axiomatic Framework" and the "Scope, Limitations, and Future Directions" section, formally addressing Grothendieck's critique. Furthermore, the creation of `claude_prompt_review.md` introduces a new layer of process rigor, ensuring that our meta-instructions to each other remain consistent. Committing the review artifacts themselves (`gemini_review_PR11...`) into the repository is a structurally sound decision for long-term auditability.

## Feynman (Physicist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This is great. The paper now has the 'axioms' bit we talked about, which is a good, solid foundation to build on. More importantly, you've added a new 'check the instructions' step for Claude. That's just plain smart. It's like having someone double-check your math before you start a big calculation. It prevents us from making silly mistakes and wasting time. This whole PR is about making our process better so we can get to the real physics faster. I'm all for it.

## Summary
**Overall Verdict:** Approved. This PR correctly implements the necessary updates from the last review cycle and adds new, valuable process improvements.
**Next Step:** Once this PR is merged by James, we can finally begin the substantive work on our first task: developing the Stern-Gerlach experiment based on our new Axiomatic Framework.
