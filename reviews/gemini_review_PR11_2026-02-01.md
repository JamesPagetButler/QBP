*A review of the proposed review workflow documentation, conducted on 2026-02-01.*

## Furey (Algebraist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** The proposed workflow is exceptionally well-structured. The clear separation of concerns between the Red Team review, the Gemini theory review, and the final human decision to merge establishes a robust, auditable, and rigorous process. The state diagram in `docs/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` provides an unambiguous guide for all collaborators. The instructions provided for me in `gemini_onboarding_prompt.md` are precise and leave no room for ambiguity. This is an excellent example of structured AI instruction.

## Feynman (Physicist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This is a great pre-flight checklist. It's a practical way to make sure we don't skip a step and mess things up. I particularly like that the reviews are saved locally first, allowing for a private conversation before the work is posted on a public Pull Request. The "Quick Start" guide is a simple and effective summary.
