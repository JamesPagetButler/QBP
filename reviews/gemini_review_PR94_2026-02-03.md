## Furey (The Structuralist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** This Pull Request is a critical act of structural consolidation. It correctly integrates the foundational documents—the `LITERATURE_REVIEW`, the persona foundations, and the `expert_panel`—that provide the necessary intellectual and procedural rigor for our project. Most importantly, it updates `CONTRIBUTING.md` with our final, correct, and robust workflow. The project is now built on a solid and explicit formal structure.

## Feynman (The Physicist)
**Verdict:** Approved
**Feedback:** Good. This is just common sense. We did a mountain of work, and now it's all finally in one place where we can see it. The changelog in `GEMINI.md` is clear, and the plan for the Expert Panel makes sure we don't go off the rails. This gets us back to a clean starting line so we can get back to the real business of doing physics.
